### About Me
Data Scientist with a passion for data visualization and machine learning. 
My data passion is twofold. First, I love to create clean and simple graphics, with a clear message. Second, I enjoy building informative machine learning models. I always try to create modular and well documented projects using clear and concise Python code. Below is one example of a data visualization I created using matplotlib and seaborn. Please check out my profile for further and more extensive examples of interests and abilities.

I love diving into complex datasets to uncover insights and build predictive models. I create clean and simple graphics using tools such as matplotlib and seaborn. And I always try to create modular and well documented projects using clear and concise Python code for my machine learning prokects. With a background in different technological fields and a conscientious personality, I bring a unique perspective to data-driven problem-solving.
